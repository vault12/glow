# Glow [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vault12/glow.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vault12/glow)
Glow is a reference client library for interacting with [Zax](https://github.com/vault12/zax), a [NaCl-based Cryptographic Relay](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/vault12/zax_infogfx.jpg). You can read the full technical specification [here](http://bit.ly/nacl_relay_spec). This reference implementation is in [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org). We will add links to other implementations in different languages as they become available.

## Version 4.0 Update
Glow 4.0 introduces support for Zax 2.0 [file exchange api](https://github.com/vault12/zax/wiki/Zax-2.0-File-Commands). Full documentation is avaiable [here](https://github.com/vault12/zax/blob/master/README.md)

## Test Dashboard
 Glow powers a test [Dashboard](https://github.com/vault12/zax-dash) app to provide user-friendly access point to given relay internal mailboxes. We maintain live [Test Server](https://z.vault12.com) that runs our latest build. For testing purposes expiration on that relay is set for 30 minutes.

## Installation
Glow can be easily installed via `npm`, which is included when you install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
In a terminal, navigate to the directory in which you'd like to install Glow and type the following:
```Shell
npm install theglow
```
The built version of Glow will be available in `dist` subdirectory, along with the minified copy.

## Running the tests
By default, the unit tests connect to known [Zax](https://github.com/vault12/zax) Cryptographic Relay Servers.
You may change this by modifying the code in [tests/helper.coffee#L57](tests/helper.coffee#L57)

```CoffeeScript
host: 'https://z.vault12.com'
```
To create a build and run the tests, navigate to the glow directory and type the following in a terminal:

```Shell
node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js
```

Note that if you have [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) installed globally, you can also simply type `gulp`.

Note that only one instance of tests can be run at the same time, since test keys are derived from the same seeds. Running multiple instances simultaneously may cause unpredicted behavior.

##### Source maps
By default, the build generates source maps and places them in the `build` directory.

If you are new to using source maps to debug, here's an overview:

Chrome: [Source Maps on Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/javascript-debugging#source-maps)

Safari: [Source Maps on Safari](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/AppleApplications/Conceptual/Safari_Developer_Guide/ResourcesandtheDOM/ResourcesandtheDOM.html)

Firefox: [Source Maps on Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Debugger/How_to/Use_a_source_map)

##### Running the tests at the command line
To run the command line tests, navigate to the glow directory and type the following in a terminal:

```Shell
node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js test
```

## Release Builds

Generate production-ready build via the command line:

```Shell
node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js dist
```

This will create the appropriate files in the following directory: `dist`

## Demo
To see Glow and Zax in action, check out the [Live Demo](https://z.vault12.com). This is a test project included in Zax called [Zax-Dash](https://github.com/vault12/zax-dash).
